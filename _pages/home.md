Hi! I am a Faculty Fellow at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/) at New York University in the [group of Ben Peherstorfer](https://cims.nyu.edu/~pehersto/group.html). 

I am working on computational methods for partial differential equations. This includes structure-preserving numerical methods for plasma physics applications and reduced order modeling to accelerate the solution of parametrized partial differential equations in multi-query contexts.

Most recently, I have been looking into magnetic relaxation methods for stellarator optimization and how generative modeling methods can be used to approximate stochastic ODE and PDE systems.

Before joining NYU, I completed my PhD at the [Technische Universität München](https://www.tum.de/) and the [Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics](https://www.ipp.mpg.de/) in the [Numerical Methods for Plasma Physics division](https://www.ipp.mpg.de/ippcms/eng/for/bereiche/numerik) with Michael Kraus and Eric Sonnendrücker. Before that, I obtained an MSc in Physics, BSc in Engineering Science from TUM and a BSc in Psychology from the University of Bamberg.
