# Intro to Computer Science (CSCI-UA 101 003)

I will be teaching Section 3 of CS 101 at NYU in Spring 2026.

All content for the lecture is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ToBlick/cs101/), including [examples](https://github.com/ToBlick/cs101-examples) and [practice problems and previous exams](https://github.com/ToBlick/cs101-examples/tree/main/docs).
